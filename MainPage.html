                <p> 
                    With upbringing from Cameroonian, Central Africa, Jordan moved to the United States at age 13 where he obtained his GDE from <a href="https://www.riordanhs.org/" rel=" ARHS "> Riordan High School</a>
                    From High school, Jordan received his acceptance letter to  <a href="https://morehouse.edu/" rel=" Morehouse "> Morehouse College </a> where he currently attends and is working on obtaining a BS in Software engineering. 
                    He strives to live a life of servitude through the lens of his desire for the well-being of others. His endeavor to grow his knowledge in the STEM field, makes him a key resource in his domain.
                    After Morehouse, Jordan looks forward to higher education and pursuing his passion for technology. With the motivation of building tools, like websites and applications, Jordan took classes like Web design to enrich 
                    himself with the understanding of the topics and methods used to build sustainable platforms of the future. His curiosity in the domain inspired him to challenge his knowledge and reaffirms his choices in pursuing a STEM degree.
