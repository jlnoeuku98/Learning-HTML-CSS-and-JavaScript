                My Story
            </h2>
            <p>
                Cameroon! Does it sound familiar? Perhaps not. That’s alright. Cameroon is where I was born. A country located in Central Africa sharing borders with Nigeria to the northwest, Chad to the north, 
                Central African Republic to the east, with Equatorial Guinea, Congo and Gabon to the south. With all these neighboring nations, I'm glad I can still enjoy the salty waters of the Atlantic Ocean 
                through the Gulf of Guinea southwest of the country. In my opinion, the humid climate—though less appealing—provides ideal conditions for the growth of cash crops, which are the cornerstone of the 
                country's economy. Well, that’s enough geography, for now.

                My name is Jordan L. Noeuku, I grew up in Yaoundé, the political capital city of Cameroon. At age nine, I moved into a small neighborhood called Eglise Des Hausa, where I created long lasting memories with my 
                siblings alongside neighborhood kids of various ages. The magic of community continued to reveal itself to me every Friday evening, when school was out, and all the kids of my neighborhood gathered on the street 
                for a soccer game. On the following Monday, school resumed, and the same kids I played with on the weekend, walked miles with me to a bright future while inhaling the dusty air of the road. The city was still under 
                development, and getting to school each morning was a challenge. But finding my way to my future was always a joyful moment because I was never alone on the journey. In a country where transportation was considered 
                an uncommon luxury, for my education was the privilege I could enjoy at price. I was determined to make the most of it.

                My journey to the United States was a dream come true. I was excited to experience a new culture, meet new people, and learn new things. I was also eager to share my culture with others. I was ready to embrace the 
                challenges that came with living in a new country. I was ready to learn and grow. I was ready to make the most of this opportunity. I was ready to make my dreams a reality. I was ready to make a difference. I was 
                ready to make the world a better place. I was ready to make my mark. I was ready to make history. I was ready to make a difference. I was ready to make a difference. I was ready to make a difference. Now, I ready more thanever
